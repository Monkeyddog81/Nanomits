## How It Works

Nanomits employs several techniques to secure your software:

- **Code Obfuscation**: This technique transforms your code into a format that is hard to read. It changes variable names, removes comments, and alters control flow, making it challenging for reverse engineers to understand your code.

- **Encryption**: Sensitive parts of your code are encrypted, adding another layer of security. This ensures that even if someone manages to access your code, they cannot easily decipher it.

- **Integrity Checks**: Nanomits performs checks to ensure that your software has not been tampered with. If any changes are detected, the software can take appropriate actions, such as shutting down or alerting the user.

- **Anti-Debugging Techniques**: These techniques prevent debuggers from attaching to your software, making it difficult for attackers to analyze its behavior.

By combining these methods, Nanomits provides a comprehensive solution for software protection.
